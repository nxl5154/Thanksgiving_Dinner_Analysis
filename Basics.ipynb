    "## Thanksgiving Dinner Survey Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis investigates the responses to a survey based on Thanksgiving dinner and their correlation with race, age, income, etc. The raw data is supplied by FiveThirtyEight through the `thanksgiving.csv` file. See the csv file for a list of questions used in the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a total of 1058 participants in the survey. of these, 92.6% of participants celebrated Thanksgiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noteworthy results of this investigation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 89.4% of this subgroup ate either pumpkin, pecan, or apple pie for dessert. Note that the False entries in the cell for this piece of data describes respondents who did in fact have pie for dessert.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 27.0% of all respondents, including those that do not celebrate Thanksgiving, are members of the 45 - 59 age group, making them the largest age subgroup in the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 17.0% of all respondents belong to the income range of \\$25,000 - \\$49,000, making it the most common income range for survey respondents. However, we note that those who selected not to answer may have impacted this result. We should also keep in mind that those that preferred to not answer were simply included with those that selected no income in the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 59.3% of all respondents who have a household income under \\$150,000, or did not provide their income, claim they have Thanksgiving somewhere other than their home. On the other hand, 52.9% of all respondents with a household income over \\$150,000 claim they have Thanksgiving somewhere other than their home. Thus household income appears to impact travel in this survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average age of respondents who attend a \"Friendsgiving\" and meet up with friends on Thanksgiving is 34.0, while all other choices have ages much higher. This result shows that the bias that younger people tend to have Thanksgiving with friends holds weight in this survey.\n",
